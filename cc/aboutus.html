<h4 align="center">-Group 6</h4>
Every college is busy conducting different types of events (inter college or intra-college) for the students and stuff. 
To manage and run these events, several technical issues have to be considered if it has to be run on machines. 
Events may have different contests for which the corresponding coordinators and judges have to be considered. 
The challenge here also includes organizing such events, contests in events, maintaining list of registered contestants, grading contestants, establishing the ranking etc. 
To realize such a system we first divide the end users into 4 categories based on their role in the entire system: Administrators, Coordinators, Judges and Contestants .
The level of abstraction and rights given to each class is different.  
Instead of using different login pages, 
we provide a centralized login page which automatically detects and provides services depending on the class and the rights given to and individual. 
The end user interface is implemented using HTML, CSS, JSP and JavaScript. 
The database and the queries will be handled by SQL and Oracle. 
To implement such a system, a central server or database is used. 
This central database will hold data relating to the events, coordinators and also the contestants. 
From this central database, data is retrieved and is used to provide functionalities required by each class. 
The insertion of data into the database is restricted by the rights given to the individual.
